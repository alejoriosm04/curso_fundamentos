# Zombies Project - The Walking Dead
## About Project
The mayor of Alexandria (community of The Walking Dead) hires us to make a software that allows managing the information of Zombies and Safes Locations of the city.

In this project, we made use of concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create efficient and reusable code. The base Programming Language of this project is Java.

The project works like a database where you can get specific information in the best possible way. Next, you will find the instructions to use this software. Enjoy it!

## How does it work?
When you start the program in the terminal, you will receive a welcome with the context of the situation that is living the major of Alexandria, Rick, and all his partners. Then, the program will start with different options. The User Interface and the User Experience are intuitive, you will understand what to do as you explore the options given to you.

However, this is a list of what has each option:

0. Close the system.
1. Enter info about Zombie.
2. Show the list of stored Zombies.
3. Show amount Zombies created.
4. Show the Zombies that contain O+ or AB+.
5. Show Zombies that were born after 2000.
6. Drop a bomb in Alexandria.
7. Enter info about ubication.
8. Show all stored ubication.
9. Show info about the safest ubication in the city.
10. Show ubications in distance order.
11. Show a random sentence.
12. How many infected people around Alexandria?

At the moment, if you close the program in the terminal, you will lose all the information that you entered.

## How to test it?

We know that you want to give it a try to this interesting project without having to download all these files and create a Java Environment. So, you can test it in [Replit](https://replit.com/~). Let us know your comments and opinions there!
